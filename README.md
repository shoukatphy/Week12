## Implementation of the K-means Clustering Algorithm
[K-means clustering](https://neptune.ai/blog/k-means-clustering) is a centroid-based clustering algorithm, where we calculate the distance between each data point and a centroid to assign it to a cluster. The goal is to identify the K number of groups in the dataset. 
## How to Run the Program?
The program can be run using root macro. Got your terminal and type **`root kmClustering.C`** or open your [root](https://root.cern/) terminal root[0] and use the command  **`.x kmClustering.C`** .

Reference
For the implementation of the k-means clustering, I have used some peices of codes from google. Actully, I couldn't figure out properly.
